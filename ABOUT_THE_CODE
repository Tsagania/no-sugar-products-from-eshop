The code is a draft piece of code I created at 3AM because I was boared. 
The main idea is to list products that do not contain sugar in them. Why no sugar? No reason, I just desided to stop consuming it.
I hand coded a bit because I'm intrested in just one super market, the Sklavenitis.gr
Outputs Look horrible, but do I end up with a list of non-sugar products? I do.

I just foced on the "Sauces" category
MY NEXT STEP IS TO SOVLE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH XML

Stay strong, stay healthy
